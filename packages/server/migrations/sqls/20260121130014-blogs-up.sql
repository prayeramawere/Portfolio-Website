INSERT INTO Blogs (_created_at,category,title,subtitle,_message,_image,link,likes,views) VALUES ('2025-10-26','tech','Here is why you are stuck watching tutorials','change your fate, learn effectively and build more projects',$$Four years ago, I began my journey as a web developer at only 13 years old. Like many beginners, I jumped from one tutorial to another trying to grasp everything. I was stuck in tutorial hell.

Every time a new software version or framework came out, I rushed to learn it without ever creating anything tangible. After two years, frustration hit me hard: I had nothing to show for all my effort.

Even after that realization, I couldn’t change much. Another year passed, and I was still stuck in the same cycle, watching, not building. Then something finally clicked. I realized I wasn’t building anything because of three main reasons: lack of consistency, fear and imposter syndrome.

1. Lack of Consistency
I eventually noticed I wasn’t fully committed. I’d code seriously for a week, then stop for two. When I came back, I’d forgotten half of what I learned and ended up watching the same tutorials again. That loop kept me trapped in tutorial hell, with little time for real projects.

2. Fear and Self-Doubt
Even after fixing my schedule, I couldn’t start my own projects. I kept asking myself:

What if I can’t make anything good enough?
What if I don’t know enough?

Become a member
Those thoughts stopped me from even trying. Every time I doubted myself, I ran back to tutorials, it felt safe.

3. Imposter Syndrome
Many times, I couldn’t convince myself that I was a real web developer. I saw how much I didn’t know and felt I needed to know it all before calling myself one. That mindset dragged me back for months.

Here Is How I Finally Escaped Tutorial Hell
After lots of failed experiments and self-reflection, I built a few systems that helped me move forward.

1. Changing My Mindset
This was the most important part. I realized being a programmer doesn’t mean knowing everything — it means using what you already know to build what you don’t.

So I started creating projects with whatever knowledge I had. Whenever I hit a gap, I researched and learned just enough to solve that problem. That’s when the concepts actually started sticking.

2. Finding Consistency Through Motivation
Even though I was now building projects, I struggled to finish them. The problem? I didn’t feel connected to them — most were AI or YouTube suggestions.

Then I joined a group of programmers on Telegram, where I met an enthusiastic game developer. He mentioned making a game template, and I suggested building a website for it. Out of curiosity, I built and deployed it and that feeling of seeing my first complete live project (driven by motive) was incredible.

After that, I started working on my portfolio website and published my first completed website everrsow, I highly recommend it. When you’re building something that represents you, it pushes you to give your best.

3. Freelancing Opened a New Door
Later, I created a freelancing account. Building websites for clients with real needs and real feedback forced me to grow faster. Every new project taught me something different and helped me get out of my comfort zone.

🌱 Still Growing
I’m still improving my skills every day and finding new ways to grow both as a developer and as a person. Escaping tutorial hell isn’t about one big moment; it’s about small, consistent steps that build confidence and experience.
